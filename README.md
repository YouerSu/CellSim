## CellSimulator

Evolution of life has always been a crucial subject in biological research, playing a pivotal role in understanding biodiversity and the mechanisms of natural selection. In the past few decades, computational simulations have emerged as powerful tools for studying the evolution of life. This paper focuses on the field of life simulation, presenting the design of a variant of the life game aimed at more realistically simulating the behavior of cells, including complex actions such as feeding, movement, division, decision-making, and inheritance. The design of this variant life game not only extends traditional life games but also represents a profound exploration of the evolution of life.

Traditional life games are simulations based on cellular automata, using simple rules and behaviors to simulate the evolutionary process of life. However, they often overlook the diversity and complexity of biological cells, as well as how they interact in different environments. In this study, we introduce more complex rules, simulating different types of cells through DNA encoding, each type having unique survival strategies and behaviors. With this design, our goal is to observe how cell populations adapt to different environmental conditions and how they evolve and develop.

The objective of this research is not only to create an engaging life simulation game but also to provide a powerful tool for biological research to explore the mysteries of life and the mechanisms of natural selection. By simulating the complex behaviors of cells, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the process of life evolution, while also opening up new possibilities for the application of computational simulations in biological research.
